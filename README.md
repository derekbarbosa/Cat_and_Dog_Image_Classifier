# Cat_and_Dog_Image_Classifier
Matlab Based "Intro to ML" project for EK381 Fall 2020 Semester

The goal of this EK 381 (Probability and Data Science) project is to understand how an algorithm can be written and "trained" with sample data sets to create a simple image classifier using eigenvalues. The image classifier would train itself to differentiate between pictures of "dogs" and "cats" based on LDA, nearest neighbor, perceptron, and closest average models.
